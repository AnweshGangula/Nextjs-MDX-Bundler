# Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

Why yes! Thanks for noticing. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

**ust once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.** _Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble._ But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

## And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.
