Reference: [MDX in Next.js using mdx-bundler](https://dipeshwagle.com/blog/use-mdx-bundler-next-js)

import Cool from "./cool";

This is an my second post.

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `mdx-bundler`.

Now I will render a cool component from the same folder.

<Cool />

I'm also using custom Link Component

Go back [home](/).
